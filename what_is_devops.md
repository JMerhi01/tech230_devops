### **What is DevOps?**
DevOps is a collaborative approach to software development that combines development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).

DevOps emphasizes communication, collaboration, integration, automation, and transparency among developers and IT operations to improve the speed and quality of software delivery.

- With the collaborative approach, problems are identified and solved more quickly.

**Reduced Risk:** 
- Regular software updates and improvements mean fewer errors and reduced risk of major issues.

**Improved Customer Satisfaction:** 

- Faster and more reliable delivery of features enhances the customer experience.
#
### **What does the role entail?**
A DevOps Engineer's role involves:

- Managing IT infrastructure according to the supported software code.
